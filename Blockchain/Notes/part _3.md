### Notes on Cryptographic Services

---

#### **Introduction**
Cryptography provides a range of essential services, each of which contributes to securing information in various contexts, especially in adversarial environments. Below are detailed explanations of the services provided by cryptography.

---

### **1. Confidentiality**
- **Definition**: Ensures that information is only accessible to authorized entities.
- **Purpose**: Protects data from being read or accessed by unauthorized individuals.

---

### **2. Integrity**
- **Definition**: Ensures that information can only be modified by authorized entities.
- **Purpose**: Guarantees the accuracy and consistency of data, preventing unauthorized tampering.

---

### **3. Authentication**
- **Definition**: Provides assurance regarding the identity of an entity or the validity of a message.
- **Types**:
    - **Entity Authentication**: 
        - Ensures that the communicating entity is active and involved in the session.
        - Commonly achieved through **single-factor authentication** (username and password) or **multi-factor authentication**.
        - **Multi-factor Authentication**:
            - **Something you have**: e.g., hardware token or smart card.
            - **Something you are**: e.g., biometric data (fingerprint, iris, retina).
    - **Data Origin Authentication** (Message Authentication):
        - Ensures that the source of the information is verified.
        - This authentication also inherently ensures **data integrity** because corroborating the source implies that the data has not been altered.
        - Methods include:
            - **Message Authentication Codes (MACs)**
            - **Digital Signatures**

---

    - **Non-repudiation protocol**: Provides evidence that an entity has performed an action.
    - **Models of Communication**:
        1. Direct communication between sender (A) and recipient (B).
        2. Communication through a **delivery agent** (A to agent to B).
    - **Key Requirements**:
        - **Fairness**: Ensures that neither party can cheat.
        - **Effectiveness**: Guarantees successful evidence transfer.
        - **Timeliness**: Ensures timely delivery of the cryptographic proof.

- **Purpose**: They help achieve various security goals such as confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and more by implementing specific security mechanisms.
- **Security Protocols**: Steps taken using cryptographic primitives to meet security objectives. Examples include:
    - **Authentication protocols**
    - **Non-repudiation protocols**
    - **Key management protocols**

#### **Taxonomy of Cryptographic Primitives**
Cryptographic primitives are divided into three categories:
1. **Keyless Primitives**
2. **Symmetric Key Primitives**
3. **Asymmetric Key Primitives**

- **Keyless primitives** and **symmetric cryptography** are discussed in this section.
- **Asymmetric cryptography** (public key cryptography) is covered in Chapter 4.

---

### **Keyless Primitives**
Keyless primitives include components that do not require keys for their functioning. Two keyless primitives are:
1. **Random Numbers**
2. **Hash Functions** (discussed later)

#### **1. Random Numbers**
- **Importance**: Randomness is a critical factor for the security of cryptographic protocols. It is used for:
    - Key generation
    - Various encryption algorithms
- **Purpose**: Randomness ensures cryptographic operations are unpredictable, preventing adversaries from inferring how algorithms work, thus securing them from cryptanalysis.

- **Categories of Randomness**:
    - **Random Number Generators (RNGs)**
    - **Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs)**

##### **Random Number Generators (RNGs)**
- **Definition**: RNGs rely on real-world randomness, known as **real randomness**, derived from physical phenomena such as:
    - Temperature variations
    - Thermal or acoustic noise from electronic components
    - Keystrokes, mouse movements, or disk movements
- **Limitations**: Real-world randomness can be difficult to collect, may have insufficient entropy, and might not always be available or accessible for long durations.

##### **Pseudorandom Number Generators (PRNGs)**
- **Definition**: PRNGs are deterministic algorithms that use a random initial value, called a **seed**, to generate a sequence of numbers that appear random.
- **Common Usage**: PRNGs are widely used in cryptography for tasks like key generation.
- **Example**: **Blum-Blum-Shub (BBS)** is a well-known PRNG.
    - Reference: [Blum, L., Blum, M., and Shub, M. (1986)](https://shub.ccny.cuny.edu/articles/1986-A_simple_unpredictable_pseudo-random_number_generator.pdf)
- **Advantages**: 
    - PRNGs are more reliable and easier to implement compared to RNGs.
    - They produce consistent outputs given the same seed, making them deterministic.

##### **Generating Random Strings with OpenSSL**
- **Command**: To generate a pseudorandom string using OpenSSL:
    ```bash
    $ openssl rand -hex 16
    ```
- **Example Output**: 
    ```
    06532852b5da8a5616dfade354a9f270
    ```
- **Exploration**: You can explore further random generation options with OpenSSL using the command:
    ```bash
    $ openssl help
    ```

---

### **Next Topic: Hash Functions**
- **Importance**: Hash functions are vital in cryptographic systems, particularly in the development and security of blockchain technology. This will be discussed in the next section.

---

These notes provide a detailed overview of cryptographic primitives, particularly focusing on keyless primitives and their role in ensuring randomness in cryptographic systems. Randomness is essential for the unpredictability and security of encryption algorithms, with both RNGs and PRNGs playing critical roles in generating secure keys.
---
### Notes on Hash Functions

---

#### **Introduction to Hash Functions**
- **Purpose**: Hash functions generate a fixed-length digest (or hash) from an arbitrarily long input string. 
- **Keyless**: They don’t require keys and are primarily used for ensuring **data integrity**.
- **Applications**: Digital signatures, Message Authentication Codes (MACs), data integrity services, and even pseudorandom number generators.

#### **Hash Function Properties**
1. **Compression**: Converts inputs of any length into a fixed-length output (usually between 128-bit to 512-bit).
2. **Efficiency**: Hash functions should be easy and fast to compute, even for large inputs.

#### **Security Properties**
1. **Pre-image resistance**: It is computationally infeasible to find an input value \(x\) from a given hash output \(y\), i.e., given \(h(x) = y\), finding \(x\) should be extremely difficult. This property is also known as the **one-way property**.
2. **Second pre-image resistance**: It is computationally infeasible to find another input \(x'\) that produces the same hash as an already given input \(x\), i.e., \(h(x) = h(x')\). This is also known as **weak collision resistance**.
3. **Collision resistance**: It is computationally infeasible to find two distinct inputs \(x\) and \(x'\) such that \(h(x) = h(x')\). This property is also known as **strong collision resistance**.

---

### **Avalanche Effect**
- **Definition**: A small change in the input (even a single bit) should result in a completely different hash output. This is an essential characteristic of a good cryptographic hash function.

---

### **Hash Function Construction**
- **Iterated Hash Functions**: These functions break the input into fixed-size blocks and then apply a compression function iteratively. One common construction is **Merkle-Damgard**, which ensures collision resistance if the underlying compression function is collision-resistant.

- **Other Constructions**:
  - **Miyaguchi-Preneel**
  - **Davies-Meyer**

---

### **Types of Hash Functions**
#### **Message Digest (MD) Functions**
- **MD4/MD5**: Popular in the early 1990s but no longer secure due to vulnerabilities found through message collisions.
    - **MD5**: A 128-bit hash function used for file integrity checks but now considered insecure.

#### **Secure Hash Algorithms (SHAs)**
- **SHA-0**: A 160-bit hash introduced in 1993 by NIST. Now deprecated.
- **SHA-1**: Also 160-bit, introduced in 1995 and used in SSL/TLS but is now insecure and deprecated.
- **SHA-2**: Includes SHA-224, SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512. These remain secure.
- **SHA-3**: The latest family of hash functions, standardized from the **Keccak** algorithm, includes SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, and SHA3-512. **Ethereum** uses Keccak, not NIST’s modified SHA-3.

#### **RIPEMD**: Based on MD4 design, available in 128-bit, 160-bit, 256-bit, and 320-bit versions.

#### **Whirlpool**: Based on the Rijndael cipher, using a **Miyaguchi-Preneel compression function**. Whirlpool has a fixed 512-bit output.

---

### **Applications of Hash Functions**
- **File integrity checks**
- **Password storage**
- **Digital signatures**
- **Cryptographic protocols** (e.g., SSL/TLS)
- **P2P networks** (e.g., file sharing, virus fingerprinting)
- **Merkle trees** and **Patricia trees**
- **Distributed hash tables**

---

### **SHA-256 Overview**
- **Input Limit**: Can process messages up to \(2^{64} - 1\) bits.
- **Block Size**: 512 bits.
- **Output Size**: 256-bit digest.
- **Compression Function**: Divides the input into 512-bit blocks, processes each in 64 rounds to produce the final hash.

**Major Components**:
1. **Padding**: Ensures that the message length is a multiple of 512 bits.
2. **Initial Hash Value**: Consists of eight 32-bit constants derived from the square roots of the first eight prime numbers.
3. **Hash Computation**: Each 512-bit block is processed iteratively through a **compression function**, producing intermediate hash values until the final hash is computed.

**Functions**:
- **Maj** (Majority function): Outputs the majority of inputs.
- **Ch** (Choice function): Selects between inputs based on a condition (like an “if-else” statement).

---

### **Next Topic: SHA-3**
- SHA-3 differs from SHA-2 in structure and design. Ethereum's **Keccak** algorithm, an earlier version of SHA-3, is used in many blockchain applications.

The **SHA-3 (Keccak)** algorithm is fundamentally different from its predecessors (SHA-1 and SHA-2) due to its use of unkeyed permutations and the **sponge construction** method rather than the Merkle-Damgard transformation. Here's a breakdown of the key concepts and functions:

### Key Concepts:
- **Sponge Construction**: The core idea behind SHA-3, it absorbs and processes input in blocks and squeezes out the transformed output. It's composed of two phases: 
  - **Absorb phase**: The input data (`m`) is padded and absorbed into the state using XOR.
  - **Squeeze phase**: The output hash is squeezed out from the state after processing the data.

- **Rate (r)**: Defines the input block size.
- **Capacity (c)**: Determines the security level.
- **State size (b)**: The sum of `r` and `c`, typically set to values like 1600 bits.

The transformation in SHA-3 involves five operations:
1. **Theta (θ)**: XOR bits in the state to mix.
2. **Rho (ρ)**: Rotates bits for diffusion.
3. **Pi (π)**: Permutes the bit positions.
4. **XOR**: Combines bits bitwise.
5. **Iota (ι)**: Adds round constants.

SHA-3 operates in 24 rounds of transformations to ensure security.

### SHA-3 Variants:
- **SHA3-224, SHA3-256, SHA3-384, SHA3-512**: These are fixed-output variants providing varying levels of security.
- **SHAKE128 and SHAKE256**: These are extendable-output functions (XOFs), where the output can be extended to any desired length.

### Applications:
1. **Proof of Work (PoW) in Bitcoin**: Uses SHA-256 to secure the mining process.
2. **Address Generation in Ethereum**: Ethereum addresses are derived by hashing public keys with Keccak-256.
3. **Merkle Trees**: Used to verify data integrity in blockchains.
4. **Digital Signatures**: Hash functions are used to create message digests, ensuring data integrity and non-repudiation.

### Merkle Tree:
A Merkle tree is a binary tree structure that efficiently verifies large datasets. By hashing pairs of child nodes and progressing to the parent nodes, the tree ultimately produces a **Merkle root**, which represents the integrity of the entire dataset. Any changes to a node will alter the Merkle root, making it a secure and efficient verification mechanism.

### Merkle-Patricia Trie:
Used in Ethereum, this hybrid data structure combines **Merkle trees** for cryptographic security and **Patricia tries** for efficient storage. It's used to store key-value pairs, such as Ethereum account balances, with keys compressed using a common prefix. The root hash of this trie is included in each block header, ensuring the integrity of the entire blockchain.

In summary, SHA-3's innovation through sponge construction, alongside its use in various blockchain applications (such as PoW, address generation, and Merkle trees), plays a crucial role in ensuring security and efficiency in decentralized systems like Bitcoin and Ethereum.

**Distributed Hash Tables (DHTs)** are a critical component of decentralized systems, enabling efficient data retrieval in peer-to-peer (P2P) networks. Here’s an overview of how they function and their significance:

### Key Concepts of DHTs:
- **Hash Table Structure**: 
  - A traditional hash table maps keys to values using a hash function to calculate an index for storage in an array of buckets. 
  - In a DHT, this concept is expanded to a distributed context where the data is spread across multiple nodes rather than being centralized.

- **Nodes as Buckets**: 
  - Each node in a DHT acts like a bucket in a traditional hash table, storing records that are accessible via their hash keys. 

- **Hashing Process**:
  - When data is added to the DHT, a hash function generates a compact key based on the data (like a filename).
  - This key is used to link the data to the corresponding node in the P2P network.

- **Data Retrieval**: 
  - When a user requests data (e.g., by filename), the filename is hashed again to produce the same key.
  - Any node in the network can be queried to locate the corresponding data, making the retrieval process efficient and decentralized.

### Advantages of DHTs:
1. **Decentralization**: DHTs eliminate the need for a central server, reducing the risk of a single point of failure and enhancing resilience against attacks.
2. **Fault Tolerance**: Since data is distributed across multiple nodes, the system can continue to function even if some nodes go offline.
3. **Scalability**: DHTs can efficiently handle increasing amounts of data and users, making them suitable for large-scale applications.

### Applications:
- DHTs are widely used in applications like file sharing (e.g., BitTorrent), distributed storage systems, and decentralized blockchain networks. They facilitate efficient data lookup, storage, and management without relying on centralized authorities.

### Connection to Cryptographic Hash Functions:
- Cryptographic hash functions play a vital role in DHTs, as they are used to generate the keys that link data to nodes. This ensures that data retrieval is consistent and secure.
- The importance of cryptographic hash functions extends to constructing Merkle trees, which enable fast verification of large datasets in blockchain technology, further highlighting their role in decentralized systems.

### Next Steps:
- Once you’ve covered symmetric key cryptography, exploring **Message Authentication Codes (MACs)** and **HMACs** (Hash-based Message Authentication Codes) will provide insight into how hash functions are used in conjunction with keys to secure data, ensuring integrity and authenticity.

In summary, DHTs represent a robust framework for decentralized data management, leveraging cryptographic hash functions to enable secure and efficient data retrieval in a distributed environment.

### Symmetric Key Cryptography

**Symmetric key cryptography** is a fundamental aspect of modern cryptography, characterized by the use of the same key for both encryption and decryption processes. Here’s an overview of its key concepts and components:

#### Key Characteristics:
1. **Shared Key**: The same key is used for both encrypting and decrypting data, necessitating a secure method of sharing the key between parties prior to communication.
2. **Secret Key Cryptography**: Often referred to as secret key cryptography due to the need for confidentiality in key distribution.

#### Key Types:
- **Static Keys**: Used over a long period, suitable for repeated sessions.
- **Ephemeral Keys**: Temporary keys generated for a single session or transaction, enhancing security.
- **Master Keys**: Used for generating and managing other keys, providing a top-level key management system.

#### Key Generation Methods:
1. **Random Generation**: Utilizing random number generators to create secure keys.
2. **Key Derivation Functions (KDFs)**: Deriving keys from passwords to enhance security. Common KDFs include:
   - PBKDF1
   - PBKDF2
   - Argon2
   - Scrypt (used in Ethereum wallets)
3. **Key Agreement Protocols**: Allow two or more parties to collaboratively generate a shared key. The **Diffie-Hellman key exchange** is a popular method in this category.

#### Randomness in Encryption:
Random values play a critical role in enhancing the security of encryption schemes. Here are key components:

- **Nonce**: A number that can only be used once within a cryptographic protocol. It prevents replay attacks by ensuring that each transaction is unique.
- **Initialization Vector (IV)**: Similar to a nonce, an IV is used to randomize the encryption process. It must be unpredictable and non-sequential, adding an extra layer of security.
- **Salt**: A unique random value added to passwords before hashing to protect against dictionary and rainbow table attacks. Each password becomes unique, making it significantly harder for attackers to crack them through brute-force methods.

### Message Authentication Codes (MACs) and HMACs

With the foundational understanding of symmetric cryptography, we can now delve into **Message Authentication Codes (MACs)** and **HMACs (Hash-based Message Authentication Codes)**:

- **MACs**: A MAC is a short piece of information used to authenticate a message and ensure its integrity. It is generated by combining the message with a secret key, allowing the recipient to verify that the message hasn’t been altered during transmission.
  
- **HMACs**: An HMAC is a specific type of MAC that utilizes a cryptographic hash function along with a secret key. The use of hash functions adds an additional layer of security, making HMACs robust against certain attacks. HMACs ensure both data integrity and authenticity, which are critical in secure communications.

### Conclusion

Symmetric key cryptography forms the backbone of many cryptographic systems, allowing for efficient data encryption and integrity checks. By understanding key types, generation methods, and the importance of randomness, we pave the way for implementing MACs and HMACs in secure communication protocols. These mechanisms are essential for ensuring the authenticity and integrity of messages in various applications, including blockchain technology and secure data exchange. 

Next, you can explore the specific algorithms and implementations of MACs and HMACs, as well as their applications in real-world scenarios.
---

### Message Authentication Codes (MACs)

**Message Authentication Codes (MACs)** are crucial cryptographic tools that ensure both the integrity and authenticity of a message. They provide a way to verify that a message comes from a legitimate sender and has not been altered in transit. Here’s a closer look at MACs and their implementation through hash-based MACs (HMACs).

#### Key Features of MACs:
- **Symmetric Cryptography**: MACs use a shared secret key between the sender and the receiver. Only those who have the key can generate or verify the MAC.
- **Data Origin Authentication**: MACs confirm the sender’s identity and the integrity of the message, ensuring that it has not been tampered with during transmission.

### Hash-Based Message Authentication Codes (HMACs)

**HMACs** are a specific type of MAC that utilizes a hash function alongside a secret key. HMACs generate a fixed-length output regardless of the length of the input message, making them efficient for message verification.

#### HMAC Construction:
HMACs can be constructed using two main methods for combining the key and the message:
1. **Secret Prefix Method**: The key is concatenated before the message.
   \[
   \text{HMAC} = \text{hash}(\text{key} \parallel \text{message})
   \]
2. **Secret Suffix Method**: The key is concatenated after the message.
   \[
   \text{HMAC} = \text{hash}(\text{message} \parallel \text{key})
   \]

While both methods have their advantages and disadvantages, the padding schemes used (i.e., inner padding and outer padding) can enhance security and mitigate certain attacks.

#### Security Assumptions:
HMAC constructions are considered secure under the assumption that the underlying hash function is secure. Various padding techniques, such as the use of inner and outer padding (ipad and opad), add complexity and security.

### Secret Key Ciphers

Secret key ciphers (or symmetric ciphers) can be categorized into **stream ciphers** and **block ciphers**:

#### Stream Ciphers:
- **Bit-by-Bit Encryption**: Stream ciphers encrypt plaintext one bit at a time using a keystream.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: The same operation is used for both encryption and decryption, often through XOR operations.
- **Keystream Generation**: Security depends on the randomness of the keystream. Common stream ciphers include RC4 and A5.

There are two types of stream ciphers:
1. **Synchronous Stream Ciphers**: The keystream is generated solely from the key.
2. **Asynchronous Stream Ciphers**: The keystream depends on the plaintext being encrypted.

#### Block Ciphers:
- **Fixed-Length Blocks**: Block ciphers encrypt data in fixed-length blocks (e.g., 64 or 128 bits).
- **Feistel Network**: Most block ciphers use a Feistel network structure, allowing for efficient encryption and decryption operations.

Common examples include:
- **Data Encryption Standard (DES)**: An older standard that encrypts data in 64-bit blocks with a 56-bit key.
- **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)**: A more secure and widely used standard that allows for 128-bit block sizes with key sizes of 128, 192, or 256 bits.

### Block Cipher Modes of Operation

Block ciphers can be used in different modes of operation, affecting how they encrypt plaintext. Here are some common modes:

1. **Electronic Codebook (ECB)**:
   - Encrypts each block independently.
   - Not secure for most applications, as it can reveal patterns.

2. **Cipher Block Chaining (CBC)**:
   - Each block is XORed with the previous ciphertext block before encryption.
   - Requires an initialization vector (IV) for the first block.

3. **Counter (CTR)**:
   - Converts a block cipher into a stream cipher by combining a nonce and a counter to create a keystream.
   - Efficient for both encryption and decryption.

### Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)

AES is a symmetric encryption standard that has become the industry norm. Here’s a brief overview:

#### Key Features:
- **Block Size**: AES operates on 128-bit blocks.
- **Key Sizes**: Supports key sizes of 128, 192, and 256 bits.
- **Number of Rounds**: The number of rounds varies based on the key size (10, 12, or 14 rounds).

#### AES Encryption Process:
1. **AddRoundKey**: XOR the state array with a subkey derived from the master key.
2. **SubBytes**: Replace bytes using an S-box for substitution.
3. **ShiftRows**: Shift the rows of the state array for diffusion.
4. **MixColumns**: Mix the columns of the state array to further spread the influence of the input bits.

The final round omits the **MixColumns** step to ensure security.

### Practical Application of AES

AES is widely used in applications, including cryptocurrency wallets:
- **Bitcoin Wallets**: Use AES-256 in CBC mode for encrypting private keys.
- **Ethereum Wallets**: Utilize AES-128 in counter mode for secure key storage and P2P communication.

### Encryption and Decryption with OpenSSL

You can use OpenSSL for AES encryption and decryption:

1. **Encrypting Data**:
   ```bash
   echo "Datatoencrypt" > message.txt
   openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -in message.txt -out message.bin
   ```

2. **Decrypting Data**:
   ```bash
   openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in message.bin -out message.dec
   ```

OpenSSL also supports encoding and decoding with base64, which is useful for ensuring compatibility with different systems.

### Conclusion

Understanding MACs, HMACs, symmetric key ciphers, and the operational modes of block ciphers like AES is fundamental to secure communications. These cryptographic primitives ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and authenticity across various applications, especially in sensitive areas such as financial transactions and personal data protection. As cryptography evolves, mastering these concepts remains critical for anyone involved in cybersecurity and information technology.
