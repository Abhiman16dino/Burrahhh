# Problem
The year is 2024. Dr. Nikita Kumari, the head researcher at a supposedly decommissioned nuclear power plant called  "Vidyut," huddles over her terminal. Lines of complex code, a fusion of artificial intelligence and quantum mechanics, scroll across the screen. Nikita's heart thumps with a mixture of exhilaration and dread. Her formula, a groundbreaking solution to the world's energy crisis, had finally reached a critical juncture. Simulations predicted near-limitless clean power, a potential utopia fueled by Nikita's brilliance.

But utopia often hides a dark underbelly. Deep within Vidyut's bowels, a different story unfolded. The waste generated by Nikita's process was unlike anything documented. Readings hinted at a silent killer, a pollutant capable of wreaking havoc on the environment. Deforestation, rampant air and water pollution, and the potential for large-scale ecological collapse loomed large. Nikita, a fervent environmentalist at heart, was caught in a moral quagmire.

Meanwhile, on the fringes of the internet, a group calling themselves the "PrakritiRakshaks" had taken notice. Operating in the shadows of the digital world, the PrakritiRakshaks were a collective of hackers dedicated to protecting the environment from corporate greed. Leading the charge was Phoenix, a cunning and resourceful individual known for their ability to crack even the most sophisticated security systems. Whispers of Vidyut's secret research had reached them, and a single Instagram profile, belonging to a seemingly ordinary young engineer named Laksh Norris, had piqued their interest. Could Laksh Norris be the key to infiltrating Vidyut and stopping Nikita's potentially disastrous project? Time was running out. The PrakritiRakshaks needed to act fast, before humanity's thirst for boundless energy came at the cost of the planet itself.


Hint: Seems like Laksh Norris has a professional account to connect with this peers and others in the industry.



# Solution
As the name was given in the problem and I figured out the solution might me somewhere in Linked Profile of Laksh Norris.
By checking LinkedIn there was something unique catched my eye inside the experience section which was the flag
