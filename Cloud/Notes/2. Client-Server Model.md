1. **Definition of Client-Server Model**:
   - A fundamental architecture in computing where a client requests services from a server.

2. **Components**:
   - **Client**: 
     - Can be a web browser or desktop application.
     - Interacts with the server to make requests.
   - **Server**: 
     - Provides services, such as Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2).
     - Evaluates requests and returns the requested information to the client.

3. **Example Scenario**:
   - A client requests:
     - A news article
     - The score in an online game
     - A funny video
   - The server processes the request and sends back the relevant information.
