- **Traffic Management in AWS**:
  - **Problem**: Uneven distribution of customer requests among multiple EC2 instances.
  - **Solution**: Implementing a load balancer to efficiently route requests.

- **Load Balancer**:
  - **Definition**: An application that takes incoming requests and distributes them to various EC2 instances.
  - **Purpose**: Ensures even workload distribution, preventing any single instance from becoming overwhelmed.

- **Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)**:
  - **Overview**: A managed service that automates the load balancing process.
  - **Key Features**:
    - **Regional Construct**: Operates at the region level, enhancing availability without extra effort.
    - **Automatic Scalability**: Adjusts to traffic changes without altering costs.
    - **Traffic Management**: Directs requests to the instance with the least outstanding requests.

- **Decoupled Architecture**:
  - **Benefit**: Simplifies backend communication by using a single URL for front-end instances to access backend instances.
  - **Scalability**: New backend instances can easily integrate without requiring updates to front-end instances.

### Major Takeaways
- Load balancing is crucial for managing traffic efficiently in cloud environments.
- ELB simplifies the process, making it highly available and scalable.
- Understanding the architecture helps in choosing the right tools for specific needs.
