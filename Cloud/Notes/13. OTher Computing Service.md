- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**: 
  - Virtual machines that you can provision for various use cases.
  - Requires management of instances, including patching and scaling.

- **AWS Lambda**: 
  - A serverless compute option that runs code in response to triggers.
  - Automatically scales and manages the underlying environment.

- **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**: 
  - A container orchestration service for running Docker containers at scale.
  - Requires management of EC2 instances.

- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**: 
  - A managed Kubernetes service for running containerized applications.
  - Similar to ECS but uses Kubernetes for orchestration.

- **AWS Fargate**: 
  - A serverless compute platform for running containers without managing EC2 instances.
  - Works with both ECS and EKS.

- **Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)**:
  - **Use Case**: Hosting a web application that requires full control over the server environment. For example, a company running a custom e-commerce platform can use EC2 to manage their web servers, databases, and application logic.

- **AWS Lambda**:
  - **Use Case**: Running a backend service for a mobile application that processes user uploads. For instance, when a user uploads an image, a Lambda function can automatically resize the image and store it in an S3 bucket without needing to manage servers.

- **Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service)**:
  - **Use Case**: Deploying a microservices architecture where different services are packaged in Docker containers. A company can use ECS to manage and scale its containerized applications, such as a payment processing service that needs to handle varying loads.

- **Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)**:
  - **Use Case**: Running a complex application that requires orchestration of multiple microservices. For example, a data analytics platform can use EKS to manage its containerized services, ensuring they communicate effectively and scale as needed.

- **AWS Fargate**:
  - **Use Case**: Running a serverless application that processes real-time data streams. For instance, a company can use Fargate to run a containerized application that analyzes streaming data from IoT devices without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.
