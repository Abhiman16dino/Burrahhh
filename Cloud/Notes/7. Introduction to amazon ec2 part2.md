### Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) Overview

1. **Introduction to Amazon EC2**
   - Provides secure, resizable compute capacity in the cloud.
   - Allows for the use of virtual servers (instances) to run applications.

2. **Traditional vs. Cloud Resources**
   - **Traditional On-Premises:**
     - Requires upfront investment in hardware.
     - Involves waiting for hardware delivery and installation.
     - Needs extensive configuration.
   - **Amazon EC2:**
     - Instances can be launched within minutes.
     - Pay only for the compute time used.
     - Cost-effective as you only pay for the server capacity needed.

3. **How Amazon EC2 Works**
   - **Launch:**
     - Select a template with basic configurations (OS, application server, etc.).
     - Choose the instance type based on hardware configuration.
     - Specify security settings to control network traffic.
   - **Connect:**
     - Multiple methods available for connecting to the instance.
     - Users can log in and access the desktop or use applications to connect.
   - **Use:**
     - Run commands to install software, add storage, and manage files.
