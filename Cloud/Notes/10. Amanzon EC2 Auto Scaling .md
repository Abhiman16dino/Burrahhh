- **Scalability**: 
  - Involves starting with necessary resources and adjusting automatically to demand.
  - Ensures you only pay for what you use, enhancing cost efficiency.

- **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**:
  - Automatically adjusts the number of EC2 instances based on application demand.
  - Helps maintain application availability by scaling in and out as needed.

- **Scaling Approaches**:
  - **Dynamic Scaling**: Responds to real-time changes in demand.
  - **Predictive Scaling**: Schedules instances based on anticipated demand.

- **Scaling Up vs. Scaling Out**:
  - **Scaling Up**: Involves adding more power to existing machines (e.g., upgrading hardware).
  - **Scaling Out**: Involves adding more machines to handle increased demand.

- **Decoupling Systems**: Allows for the right amount of resources for each part of the process, avoiding over-provisioning.

- **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**:
  - Automatically adjusts the number of instances based on demand.
  - Decommissions instances when they are no longer needed, ensuring efficient resource use.

- **Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling**:
  - Allows flexible scaling of applications in the cloud.
  - **Minimum Capacity**: Set to ensure at least one EC2 instance is always running.
  - **Desired Capacity**: Can be set higher than the minimum; defaults to minimum if not specified.
  - **Maximum Capacity**: Limits the number of EC2 instances to prevent over-scaling.

- **Cost Efficiency**:
  - You only pay for the EC2 instances you use, making it a cost-effective solution.
  - Provides a balance between customer experience and expense reduction.
