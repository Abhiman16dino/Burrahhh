### Notes on Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)

1. **Introduction to EC2**
   - EC2 is a service that provides virtual servers for hosting applications.
   - It operates on the client-server model, where clients send requests to servers.

2. **Benefits of Using EC2**
   - **Flexibility**: Easily spin up or terminate instances as needed.
   - **Cost-Effectiveness**: Pay only for the compute capacity you use.
   - **Speed**: Quick setup compared to traditional on-premises servers.

3. **Traditional vs. EC2 Setup**
   - Traditional setup involves:
     - Researching and purchasing hardware.
     - Waiting for delivery and installation.
     - Managing physical servers.
   - EC2 eliminates these steps by providing ready-to-use virtual servers.

4. **How EC2 Works**
   - EC2 instances are launched within minutes.
   - Users can stop or terminate instances without being locked into hardware.

5. **Multitenancy and Security**
   - EC2 uses virtualization technology to share physical resources among multiple instances.
   - Each instance is isolated and secure, managed by a hypervisor.

6. **Configuration and Control**
   - Users can choose the operating system (Windows or Linux) and configure software on instances.
   - Instances can be resized based on application needs (vertical scaling).

7. **Networking Control**
   - Users decide on the accessibility of their instances (public or private).

8. **Innovation and Efficiency**
   - EC2 allows businesses to innovate quickly by simplifying server acquisition and management.
