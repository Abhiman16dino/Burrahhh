- **Definition of Cloud Computing**: 
  - On-demand delivery of IT resources over the Internet.
  - Pay-as-you-go pricing model.

- **On-Demand Delivery**:
  - Resources are available when needed without prior notification.
  - Example: Launching 300 virtual servers or using 2,000 terabytes of storage instantly.

- **Flexibility**:
  - Users can return resources quickly and stop payments immediately.
  - This flexibility is not achievable with traditional data centers.

- **IT Resources Philosophy**:
  - AWS offers a wide range of products to meet common business needs.
  - Common IT tasks are considered "undifferentiated heavy lifting."

- **Importance of Data**:
  - The uniqueness of a business lies in how it manages its data, not in the tools used to manage it.

- **Accessing Resources**:
  - Resources can be accessed securely via a web console or programmatically.
  - No need for additional contracts or sales calls.

- **Pay-As-You-Go Pricing**:
  - Similar to staffing a shop based on peak hours, businesses only pay for resources when they are in use.
